# Montronix Data Collector
A C# Service to collect data from Montronix Pulse Plus Accelerometer/Vibration sensors and send them to an MQTT Broker.

Collected data were used by a custom MES (Manufacturing And Execution System) I developed in PHP language built on my [PHP WEB MVC Framework](https://github.com/rcarvello/webmvcframework),
